# CMOS and WER Evaluation Dataset Repository

Welcome to the repository for CMOS and WER evaluation datasets and related files. This repository contains the necessary resources for evaluating audio datasets, including CMOS evaluation data, WER datasets, and transcriptions.

## Contents

1. **CMOS Evaluation Audio Dataset**
    - This dataset contains audio files used for CMOS (Comparative Mean Opinion Score) evaluation, which is commonly used to assess the quality of text-to-speech (TTS) systems.

2. **WER Evaluation Audio Dataset**
    - This dataset includes audio files intended for evaluating Word Error Rate (WER), an objective metric in speech recognition systems.

3. **WER Transcriptions for TTS**
    - Contains transcriptions of audio data used in WER evaluations, specifically for text-to-speech systems and ground truth for transcriptions. These transcriptions are important for aligning and calculating WER accurately.



## Usage

### CMOS Evaluation
1. Access the CMOS evaluation audio dataset from the `cmos_evaluation` folder.
2. Follow the standard CMOS scoring methodology to evaluate the TTS quality using this dataset.

### WER Evaluation
1. Locate the WER evaluation audio dataset in the `wer_evaluation` folder.
2. Use the  transcriptions provided in same folder.
3. Follow the standard WER calculation to evaluate the TTS using this dataset
